# MySQLProject
A database simulation program
Final project for the Object-Oriented Programming course in the second year of university.We worked in teams of 3 to create a program in C++ that simulates a database.Data that we create/insert/update through the "SQL commands" is stored in text/binary files.
Creating a table - generates a text file with the type of variables declared & we keep track of what tables we've already created through a different text file "ListOfTables" so we won't be able to create a table with an already existing name.
Inserting values - stores the data in binary files.
Selecting / Updating / Deleting data - modifies the binary file.
All the changes made are displayed in the console.The program starts with a small menu.
